The tax calculation is based on the user's total income after deducting any applicable deductions.
If the total income is less than or equal to 8 Lakhs, no tax is applied.
If the total income exceeds 8 Lakhs, the tax is calculated based on the user's age group:
For users under 40 years old (`age < 40`), a tax rate of 30% is applied to the income exceeding 8 Lakhs.

For users aged between 40 and 60 years (40 ≤ age < 60), a tax rate of 40% is applied to the income exceeding 8 Lakhs.
For users aged 60 years or older (age ≥ 60), a tax rate of 10% is applied to the income exceeding 8 Lakhs.
